# Rust UniswapV2 data extractor

## Running

`cargo run --release -- --rpc-url https://polygon-mainnet.example-rpc.com`

`--rpc-url` â€” param is required, while `--from-block` and `--to-block` has a default vaules

## How it works

### High level
- The program scans blockchain blocks and filters them based on the Swap event produced by UniswapV2Pair contracts within a specified block range, with the default range set from `52,900,000` to `53,000,000`.
- In the second step, it loads and updates the affected pools with corresponding tokens' metadata.
- Following that, it retrieves the reserves of the touched pools by calling the getReserves function from a UniswapV2Pair contract.
- As the fourth step, it loads the balances of the token vaults for each UniswapV2Pair and stores them in a separate map.
- `strange_reserves` sets to `true` if there are differences in balances. Saves processing result to an `output.json` file.

### Low level
- Request all tx logs in a specific block range, collect transactions that matches with UniswapV2Pair `Swap` event topic and extract pool addresses that fire this event
- After touched pools extraction it loads and initialize all necessary pool data
- Then request pool reservs for a each block in a block range
- At the final step when all data is synced program processes all pools to find all inequalities between token vaul balances and pool reserves by marking them as a `strange_reserves` in a final output JSON
